# Firebase Setup for Just Hangin

This document tracks the setup status of Firebase for the Just Hangin app.

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Firebase CLI installed
2. ✅ Firebase project created: `just-hangin-85f22`
3. ✅ Firebase initialized in the project
4. ✅ Environment variables configured with Firebase credentials
5. ✅ Firestore security rules deployed (set to allow all operations for testing)
6. ✅ Firestore Database set up
7. ✅ Firebase Storage set up and rules deployed
8. ✅ AsyncStorage package installed for future authentication persistence
9. ✅ Firebase configuration updated to include Storage and improved Analytics initialization
10. ✅ Firebase Authentication set up with Email/Password authentication
11. ✅ Initial Firestore collections created:
    - `users` - Stores user profile information
    - `friendships` - Manages friend relationships
    - `locationPins` - Stores location pins created by users

## Known Issues

1. ⚠️ Firebase Auth persistence with AsyncStorage
   - The app currently shows a warning about Firebase Auth not using AsyncStorage for persistence
   - This requires additional configuration with the correct imports from 'firebase/auth/react-native'
   - For now, we're using standard auth to avoid compatibility issues
   - Authentication state will not persist between app restarts

2. ⚠️ React Navigation errors in PinDetailsScreen
   - There's a warning about updating a component during rendering
   - This needs to be fixed in the PinDetailsScreen component

## Firebase Setup Summary

### 1. Firebase Project
- Project created: `just-hangin-85f22`
- App registered with Firebase
- Firebase configuration stored in environment variables

### 2. Firebase Services
- Authentication: Email/Password authentication enabled
- Firestore Database: Set up with initial collections
- Storage: Set up for storing user files
- Analytics: Configured conditionally based on platform support

### 3. Security Rules
- Testing rules deployed (allow all operations for testing)
- Production rules ready to be uncommented when needed

## Testing the App

The app is now running with temporary security rules that allow all operations for testing purposes. You can test the app by:

1. Starting the app with `npx expo start`
2. Scanning the QR code with your Expo Go app
3. Testing the following functionality:
   - User registration and login
   - Creating and viewing location pins
   - Sending and accepting friend requests
   - Updating your profile

## Important Security Note

⚠️ **The current Firestore and Storage rules allow all read and write operations for testing purposes. Before deploying to production, you must update the security rules to restrict access appropriately.**

To restore the secure rules, edit `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` to uncomment the secure rules and remove the testing rules, then deploy them with:
```
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify that all Firebase services are properly set up
3. Ensure that your Firebase configuration in the `.env` file matches your Firebase project
4. Check that the Firestore and Storage rules are properly deployed
5. For authentication persistence issues, ensure AsyncStorage is properly configured
