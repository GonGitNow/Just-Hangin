# Just Hangin - Project Plan

## Project Overview

Just Hangin is a mobile application that allows users to share their hangout locations with friends. The app enables users to drop pins on a map with notes and time information, and choose which friends can see their hangout spots.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure (Week 1)

**Milestone: Project Foundation**
- Set up React Native with Expo development environment
- Configure Firebase project (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- Establish project structure and navigation flow
- Create basic UI components library
- Implement authentication system (signup, login, password reset)

**Tasks:**
1. Initialize Expo project with TypeScript template
2. Set up Firebase project and configure services
3. Create navigation structure using React Navigation
4. Design and implement UI component library
5. Build authentication screens and logic
6. Set up Firestore database with initial security rules

### Phase 2: Map Functionality and Pin Management (Week 2)

**Milestone: Core Map Features**
- Implement map interface with user location
- Create pin dropping functionality
- Build pin detail view and creation form
- Implement basic pin filtering

**Tasks:**
1. Integrate react-native-maps with user location tracking
2. Create map screen with pin visualization
3. Implement pin creation interface with form validation
4. Build pin detail view with edit/delete capabilities
5. Add time selection for hangout scheduling
6. Implement pin expiration logic

### Phase 3: Friend System and Privacy Controls (Week 3)

**Milestone: Social Features**
- Implement friend search and request system
- Create friend list management
- Build privacy controls for pin sharing
- Implement user profiles

**Tasks:**
1. Create user search functionality
2. Build friend request system (send, accept, reject)
3. Implement friend list management interface
4. Create privacy settings for controlling pin visibility
5. Build user profile screen with customization options
6. Implement visibility filtering for pins on the map

### Phase 4: Notifications and Polish (Week 4)

**Milestone: Complete MVP**
- Implement push notifications
- Add offline support
- Optimize performance
- Polish UI/UX
- Conduct testing and bug fixes

**Tasks:**
1. Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
2. Implement notification triggers for new pins and friend requests
3. Add offline support with data synchronization
4. Optimize map performance with clustering for multiple pins
5. Polish UI/UX across all screens
6. Conduct thorough testing and fix identified bugs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components and functions
- Validate form inputs and validation logic
- Test authentication flows

### Integration Testing
- Test interaction between components
- Validate data flow between screens
- Test Firebase integration

### User Testing
- Conduct usability testing with potential users
- Gather feedback on UI/UX
- Identify and address pain points

## Deployment Plan

### Beta Testing
- Deploy to Expo for internal testing
- Distribute to limited test users
- Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments

### Production Release
- Build standalone apps for iOS and Android
- Submit to App Store and Google Play
- Prepare marketing materials and launch strategy

## Technical Debt Management

Throughout development, we will maintain a list of technical debt items to be addressed:
- Code refactoring needs
- Performance optimizations
- Security enhancements
- Documentation improvements

## Resource Allocation

- 1 React Native Developer (full-time)
- 1 UI/UX Designer (part-time)
- Firebase resources (Spark/Blaze plan depending on usage)

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Map Performance**: Large number of pins may cause performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement clustering and pagination

2. **Firebase Costs**: Heavy usage may increase costs
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient queries and monitor usage

3. **User Adoption**: Users may not find the app intuitive
   - Mitigation: Conduct early user testing and iterate based on feedback

4. **Platform Compatibility**: Issues with specific devices
   - Mitigation: Test on various devices and implement platform-specific code when necessary

## Success Metrics

- User registration and retention rates
- Number of pins created per user
- Friend connections established
- App usage frequency
- User satisfaction ratings

## Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### Phase 5: Enhanced Social Features
- Group creation for easier sharing
- Event planning with RSVP functionality
- Activity feed showing friend updates

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Photo sharing at locations
- Integration with calendar apps
- Real-time chat functionality
- Location-based reminders

### Phase 7: Monetization
- Premium features (extended pin history, advanced customization)
- Optional subscription model
- Partnership opportunities with local businesses
